# Project Euler trial

A repo to store my attempts in solving project euler problems with a TDD approach.

## Description

I started this repo for some practice on TDD & functional programming in Python.
For each problem, rather than just computing the required numerical answer, my approach in this repo would be to create a general solution func that can accept different parameters.
Also, I plan to extract reusable codes into util functions, which are kept in a separate file.
Test for each solution function and util function are included as well.
(I use Pytest as the testing framework here)
